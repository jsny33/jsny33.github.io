# Project 1

This website is a portfolio website, showcasing my prior coursework and projects I have completed. It has four pages, a home page, an about me page, a coursework page, and a project page. Navigation between these pages is handled by a mobile-responsive bootstrap navbar.

Index.html represents the homepage of the website, and includes the navbar, a picture of myself, and a link to my LinkedIn profile.

In the html folder:
About.html only contains a very short statement about myself, as well as the navbar.

Courses.html contains a table filled with some of the classes I have taken, as well as what semester I took them in.

Projects.html contains two lists of projects I have completed, aligned by two bootstrap columns.


In the scss folder:
style.scss contains all of my styling code, including a mobile-responsive section that changes the sizes of the images in index.html depending on the screen width.

style.css and style.css.map were generated by scss.


In the media folder:
Profile.png is the profile picture used in index.html.

LinkedIn.png is the picture used to link to my LinkedIn profile.

While most of the code was ideated by me, some inspiration and examples from w3schools and the bootstrap 4.1 documentation were used.
